## üï∏Ô∏è Project Description

The main objective of this project is to create a web application that allows for the easy and accessible sale of mobil-homes for entrepreneurs in the buying and selling sector. Mobil-homes have become an attractive and economical option for many people looking for alternative housing. That's why this project will develop a web application that allows the entrepreneur or sales manager of mobil-homes to easily and accessible publish their products without the need for technical knowledge, including the ability to attach photographs for each product. Additionally, anyone can view the products for sale and those that have already been sold, and registered users can also view discounted products.
